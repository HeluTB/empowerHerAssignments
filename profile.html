        <p>My name is Helen Tewoldebirhan. I am a student at HiLCoE School of Computer Science and Technology. <br>
            I am a Software Engineering major and I am in my 3rd year of study. I am interested in web development <br>
            and I am currently learning web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. <br>
            I am also interested in learning new technologies and programming languages. I am looking forward <br>
            to learning more about web development and software engineering and I am excited to see where my <br>
            studies will take me. I am glad to be part of this community <i><strong style="color:saddlebrown">Empower Her</strong></i>, <br>
